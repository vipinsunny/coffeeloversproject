            <h2>WELCOME TO THE PAGE<strong> COFFEE LOVERS PROJECT</strong></h2>
            <p>Coffee lovers around the world who reach for their favorite morning brew probably aren’t thinking about
                its health benefits or risks. And yet this beverage has been subject to a long history of debate. In
                1991 coffee was included in a list of possible carcinogens by the World Health Organization. By 2016 it was
                exonerated, as research found that the beverage was not associated with an increased risk of cancer; on
                the contrary, there was a decreased risk of certain cancers among those who drink coffee regularly once
                smoking history was properly accounted for. Coffee contains a number of useful nutrients, including riboflavin
                (vitamin B-2), niacin (vitamin B-3),magnesium, potassium, and various phenolic compounds, or antioxidants. Some experts suggest that these
                and other ingredients in coffee can benefit the human body in various ways.
                Researchers have looked at the benefits of drinking coffee for conditions such as diabetes,
                cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver disease.</p>

        <!-- <h2>Coffee Drinkers</h2>
            <p>Coffee for some is an indispensable part of their everyday lives and it’s not just for the caffeine buzz.
                It’s about the experience from the roasting process and experimenting with different roast combinations
                to the actual taste and smell of the final product.
                You might call us pretentious or find us to be insufferable but for those of us that can define a
                nightmare as having no coffee available.</p>

            <!-- <p>Coffee Confidential lists four reasons why you shouldn’t buy pre-ground coffee – contamination, oxygen, moisture and carbon dioxide depletion. You can read more about it on their site, but basically coffee beans have volatile flavor compounds and aromatics that dissipate once the bean becomes ground. This means that the longer the ground is allowed to sit, the more dull the flavor gets until it finally becomes stale and tastes like that sludge that’s been sitting in the coffee pot at work for way too long.</p> -->

            <h2>Benefits of Coffee</h2><br>
            <p>The biggest benefit and the most known fact about coffee is that, no matter how sleepy you are, it will
                ensure you jerk up to alertness. If you are a black coffee lover, you just earned yourself some perks.
                An important benefit of coffee,
                especially for black coffee lovers, is that coffee increases your metabolism at least by 11%. Because of
                this reason, it also helps you in losing weight. In fact, the latest trend called “Green Coffee” has hit
                the market which helps you lose weight faster.It is a similar concept to Green Tea, but it has an
                acquired taste. Well, not that Green Tea is any tastier. The green coffee beans need to be ground
                without roasting them. Though it is claimed to have a lesser amount of caffeine, it still works the same
                way.Contrary to popular belief, coffee helps you stay away from many chronic diseases like type 2
                Diabetes, Alzheimer’s, Dementia, Parkinson’s and a few other neural diseases. All these, if you are a
                black coffee drinker.Having coffee helps you with a sharper mind and attentiveness. You would hardly
                miss anything. It
                increases your body temperatures, ensuring you keep warm in the cold days. </p>

            <h2>The Funny Psychology Of Why We Love The Taste Of Coffee</h2>
            <p>If you’re a coffee lover, you know that drinking coffee is a complex and nuanced experience—there’s the
                rich aroma, the comforting warmth, and the loveliness of the ritual of sitting down with a fresh cup.
                But if you focus on the actual taste of coffee on your tongue, there’s no getting around the fact that
                it’s quite bitter, and bitterness isn’t always the most delectable taste. In fact, long ago, we evolved
                to avoid it.

                But according to a new study from Northwestern University, coffee lovers aren’t less sensitive to the
                bitter taste, as you might guess; they’re actually more sensitive to it, which points to an interesting
                psychological phenomenon behind our love of coffee.The researchers wanted to see how people’s
                sensitivity to different bitter tastes correlated with their level of coffee drinking. So they looked at
                data from over 400,000 people, from the UK Biobank, which contains genetic information about its
                participants. The team focused on three different bitter tastes: caffeine, quinine (which gives tonic
                water its bitter flavor), and propylthiouracil, a synthetic bitter compound. They correlated these data
                with information about how much coffee people drank. </p>

        <h2>Guide to Coffee</h2><br>
        <p>Coffee is one of the most favored beverages all over the world. It’s full of antioxidants and
            flavonoids. Both these elements make it a pleasant morning drink for our health, but most of us are not
            aware of the origin of coffee beans. Have you ever wondered, “where do coffee beans come from?”

            In this quick guide, we’ll be diving into the history, types, and unique facts about coffee beans.
            According to legend, the discovery of coffee beans goes back to 600 A.D. in Ethiopia, Africa, (known as
            the province of Kaffa), where a goat herder noticed that his goats became energetic after eating a
            bright-colored cherry on a bush.

            The goat herder then ate the same fruit to see its effect, and surprisingly, he experienced a rush of
            energy within a few minutes. He later plucked some coffee berries and brought them to a monk. The monk
            went on to make a drink out of those coffee cherries. To his astonishment, he was able to concentrate
            more during his midnight prayer. That’s when the first cup of coffee was born! The discovery of that
            magical drink spreads like fire, and as they say, the rest is history.
